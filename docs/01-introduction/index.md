# Introduction

The goal of this documentation is provide a foundation of swarm capabilities and enablers into the OpenSwarm code base on which the technologies from WP2-4 build. 

**Swarm capabilities** address both static and mobile nodes (robots), with an emphasis on the latter. They include general task-centric approaches and robotic abilities, such as localization, path planning, navigation and mapping, as well as specific swarm approaches, such as swarming, foraging, coverage, and others. 

**Swarm enablers** include a software architecture that allows for the OpenSwarm code base to run both on small micro-controllers (e.g., Kilobot, DotBot), and as part of the Robot Operating System (ROS) on more capable platforms (e.g., on UAVs in T6.2), in an interoperable fashion. The outcome of this work is used directly into T5.2, then indirectly for all verification (T5.2, T5.5) and PoCs (WP6).

This documentation is the deliverable **D5.1 Foundation of the OpenSwarm implementation with corresponding documentation**
