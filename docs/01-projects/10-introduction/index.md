# Introduction

The projects presented on this page reflect my direct participation in the design, implementation, and deployment of robotic systems operating in real-world environments. Rather than purely conceptual or simulated work, these efforts were shaped by the practical constraints of field robotics, including imperfect sensing, limited computational resources, safety requirements, and operational reliability.

My involvement has spanned the full development cycle, from algorithmic research and system architecture to integration, testing, and on-site deployment on physical robotic platforms. Several of these projects required close interaction with multidisciplinary teams, where theoretical models had to be adapted to hardware limitations and unpredictable environmental conditions.
